We are so busy running around that we have to eat convenient foods that are usually bad for us.  My goal is to change that through my fresh squeezed juices.  I used to go to the local juice bar nearby everyday, until i realized it was breaking my bank.  I figured others go through what I went through, so I wanted to offer people quality juices at an affordable price.  Because we all deserve to have healthy options."
