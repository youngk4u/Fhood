I grew up eating a certain famous square shaped burger and since I moved to San Francisco, haven’t been able to find a good substitute.  Lucky for me I have a recipe that tastes just as good as the original!  It’s my pleasure to bring a little piece of the midwest to the west coast.  Thanks for dropping by and I look forward to serving you!"
